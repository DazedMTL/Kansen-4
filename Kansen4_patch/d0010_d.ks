Daisuke, puffing out his chest because he's a man, volunteered to take[r]
charge of the most dangerous part, the lift entrance, and dashed off.[pcms]

*7496|
[fc]
I took responsibility for checking the fire doors in the first-floor[r]
corridor, the back service entrance, and locking all the windows, just[r]
as I had said I would. Kozue-chan and Aya-san were asked to take care[r]
of locking each classroom.[pcms]

*7497|
[fc]
Right after Daisuke ran off, I parted ways with Kozue-chan and Aya-san[r]
on the spot.[pcms]

*7498|
[fc]
I locked the door that I thought was probably the service entrance at[r]
the back. Then, I made sure to lock all the windows as well. All[r]
that's left is to close the fire doors, and my part will be done.[pcms]

I could see the mountain range from the window at the back. The[r]
weather was so clear without a single cloud, making the green[r]
ridgelines stand out sharply against the blue sky; it was beautiful.[pcms]

*7500|
[fc]
Even considering I was indoors, it didn't feel too hot, and I bet it[r]
would feel great to ride a motorcycle on a day like today. It's[r]
perfect weather for touring.[pcms]

*7501|
[fc]
Even going as far as a thousand units wouldn't be a struggle; I could[r]
cross over Sugi Tree Pass without any trouble and arrive in less than[r]
two hours![pcms]

"...Hehe..."[pcms]

*7503|
[fc]
...How silly of me. Even in this situation, what am I thinking about?[r]
Even though I've finally found a place to rest, I'm thinking about[r]
touring weather, huh.[pcms]

*7504|
[fc]
But... honestly, if I don't think about something fun that's[r]
completely different from reality, it feels unbearable...[pcms]

*7505|
[fc]
If I start to dwell on everything that's happened since yesterday, I[r]
get restless and start to tremble...[pcms]

*7506|
[fc]
But everyone is trying their best, especially Daisuke who is doing[r]
more than anyone else... In such times, I can't afford to be the only[r]
one feeling down.[pcms]

*7507|
[fc]
It might seem silly given the current situation, but if I don't think[r]
about something fun for the future, I feel like I'll be crushed by[r]
fear. To prevent that, I have to think about fun things...[pcms]

*7508|
[fc]
Once the kids arrive, I'll have to play a lot with them. For Wataru,[r]
I'll thoroughly instill the fun of motorcycles this summer. Taking[r]
Ren-chan on a touring ride sounds good too.[pcms]

*7509|
[fc]
Ah, that's right. In the future, I'll add Wataru to my racing team.[r]
Ren-chan as a mascot girl? No, no, maybe she can write our team's[r]
theme song...[pcms]

*7510|
[fc]
Before any of that though, I need to finish Daisuke's bike and go for[r]
a ride on the mountain pass during summer vacation. It'll be fun to[r]
decide whether to hire him as an engineer or a racer based on how well[r]
he rides.[pcms]

*7511|
[fc]
My bike that I left behind. Daisuke's bike that was nearing[r]
completion... Is it okay...? Not broken...? What about home, the[r]
garage, dad and mom... are they okay...?[pcms]

"...Ugh...uhuhuh..."[pcms]

*7513|
[fc]
Suddenly, tears started overflowing from my eyes. No good. I have to[r]
think about something more fun. No good at all! Stupid me! Don't cry!![pcms]

*7514|
[fc]
Despite my will, tears kept flowing, and as strength drained from my[r]
body, I crouched down just a little and cried.[pcms]

*7515|
[fc]
After crying and feeling a bit clearer, I have to pull myself[r]
together... right.[pcms]
